# DispatchMemoryLeakDemo

### [UPDATED] It seems to be a problem of Xcode debug session instead. If you turn off the "Queue Debugging" option in scheme settings, everything goes fine. See [this](https://github.com/onevcat/DispatchMemoryLeakDemo/issues/2) for more.

A demo that reproduce memory leak in iOS 9.2. You can find the report here [radar://23894846](http://openradar.appspot.com/radar?id=5013034456055808).
